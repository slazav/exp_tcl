    Experimental setup for 3He NMR measurements on dry demag cryostat

    Hardware

There is a rack with a computer (Altlinux OS), network switch and
devices. The switch is configured for two networks^ internal and
external. All devices are connected to the internal one, computer can
see both, external network is connected to NANO network.


Devices with ethernet interface connected directly to the switch; GPIB
devices are connected through a Prologix gpib2eth converter; USB devices
are connected to computer directly. There is a possibility to use
gpib2usb converter.

TODO: make guest user on the computer, make regular backups (now it is done manually)

Devices:
* SRS RF-lockin -- for NMR
* Keysight 2-channel generator -- for NMR
* Keysight generator    -- for fork
* Pico4224 oscilloscope -- for fork
* Keysight power supply: 2 precision units for main magnet, 2 simple units for gradient and quadratic coils,
* Tenma power supply

TODO: second NMR channel (lockin, 2-ch generator)


    Software

TCL Device library ( https://github.com/slazav/exp_tcl/tree/master/Device ) --
access devices and programs from command line or tcl script. Locks, timeouts,
error messages, remote access etc.

Graphene database ( https://github.com/slazav/graphene ) -- storing data
and comments with timestamps. Fast access to data. Can be used from
command line or through TCL Device library. Databases can be browsed
using Graphana server or GrapheneViewer.

Pico_rec ( https://github.com/slazav/pico_osc ) -- recording signals
using Pico4224 oscilloscope, processing signals (noise spectra, sliding
FFT, fitting fork signals, crosscorrelation etc.) Can be used from 
command line or through TCL Device library.

GrapheneMonitor ( https://github.com/slazav/exp_tcl/tree/master/GrapheneMonitor ) --
TCl library for writing modules (scripts for making regular measurements)
and monitor panels which run modules, store data in a database, show data plots.

GrapheneViewer ( https://github.com/slazav/exp_tcl/tree/master/GrapheneViewer ) --
TCL library for making graphene database wiewers. Fast access to large amounts of
data and comments, autoupdate etc.
