    Command line protocol
======================================================================

There are two programs, "server" and "client". Client opens connection
with server, send requests, get answers.

Normally server is a program with a command line interface, called by
a user or another program (client). All data are read and written
line by line in a human-readable form if possible.

When connection is opened, server writes a line with the special symbol
('#' in this example, but it can be any symbol), protocol name and
version: "#CL001". Then it can write some text for the user which can be
ignored. Then it either writes '#Error: <message>' and exits or writes
'#OK' and start listening for user requests. Simbol '#' here is a special
symbol which was selected in the beginning of the conversation.

Request is one line of text.
TODO: splitting arguments, quoting, several lines...

Answer of the server is a few lines of text, followed by '#Error:
<message>' or '#OK' line. Lines of the answer text starting with the
special symbol should be protected by doubling the symbol.

Conversation example:

> ./server example
#CL001
Welcome, dear user!
type "help" to see command list.
#OK
h
#Error: 
text1
text2
#OK
#

##text
#OK
#
